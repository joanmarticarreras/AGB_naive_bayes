In this folder users can find: bin/ and plots/.

Inside bin folder 3 perl scripts will be found: 

- tt_separator => Creates the files for training and testing K times, for a K-fold validation (where K = 5). Transforms into discrete values the expression measures. Also filters NA and Inf values.

- NotSoNaive.pl => It models the information gain or mutual information of the testing genes and then does the prediction.

- f_calculator. pl => It calcules the statistics used to test the success rate of the classification.

For runing any of them, please use help command.

Inside plots/ there will be a copy of the plots obtained during our tests.
